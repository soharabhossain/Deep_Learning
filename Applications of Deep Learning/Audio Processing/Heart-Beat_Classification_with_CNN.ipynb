Therefore, being able to detect abnormalities in heartbeats is an important task. \n","\n","Out motivation here is to be able to automatically classify and distinguish normal heartbeats from abnormal ones.\n","\n","The proposed solution is a DL model that can classify real heart audio (also known as “beat classification”) into one of multiple categories: **Normal, Extrahls, Murmur, Artifact or Unlabeled.** \n","\n","Heartbeats consist of 2 consecutive noises called ‘lub’ and ‘dub’ which are produced due to the heart movements. \n","These noises are of varying frequencies and occur in close proximity in normal situations. \n","\n","We aim to use CNN to classify these heartbeats into the aforementioned
